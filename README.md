**Grand River Transit SMS Application**

This is a test application to test different android functionality such as SMS messaging and geofence detection (GPS).

The purpose of this app is to detect if the user has entered a pre-defined geofence near a bus-stop in Waterloo, ON.
The app would then send an SMS message periodically to Grand River Transit to get the latest bus arrival updates and display them in the app.
This was to test the possibility of getting latest bus arrival updates without the need for WiFi or mobile data. (User interface needs development)
